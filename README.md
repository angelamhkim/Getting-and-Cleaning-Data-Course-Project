# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Course project for Course

This repository includes a code book explaining the variable names and an R script that analyzes the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. More information on this data set can be found on the UCI Machine Learning website (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

# R Script 
The R Script analyzes the data as required by the course project as follows: 
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The script itself ("run_analysis.R") is separted into four parts that fit into the project requirements. 

# Code Book 
The code book contains information on the variables found in the final table produced by the R Script.
